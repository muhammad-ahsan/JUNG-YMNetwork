Yahoo! Instant Messenger friends connectivity graph, version 1.0

=====================================================================

Millions use Yahoo! Messenger every day to communicate by text or by
voice between PCs or from PCs to phones. This dataset contains a
non-random sample of the Yahoo! Messenger "friends graph" from 2003,
where users are represented as meaningless anonymous numbers so that
no identifying information is revealed. Users are nodes in the graph.
An edge between two users indicates that at least one user is a
contact of the other. (The direction of the contact relationship is
ignored, producing an undirected graph.) The dataset consists only of
the anonymous friends graph, and does not contain any information
about users or discussions.

The file is in Metis format. There is one header line in the format:
N M
indicating the total number of nodes N and the total number of edges M
in the graph. Following the header line, there are N adjacency list
lines, one for each node, in order, starting with node 1. The
adjacency list line for each node lists the node's neighbors,
separated by spaces. Each adjacency list includes the neighboring
nodes only, and does not explicitly include the ID of the originating
node -- the ID of the originating node is implicit according to the
line number in the file. For more information on the Metis graph data
format see the Metis manual, obtainable from the website of George
Karypis here:

The data contains:

1,878,736 nodes (representing anonymous users)
4,079,161 edges (representing contacts between users)

The Yahoo! Messenger friends graph is an example of a large real-world
power-law graph. The dataset may serve as a testbed for matrix and
graph algorithms including PCA and graph clustering algorithms, and
machine learning algorithms. The graph's best quotient cuts show an
interesting tradeoff between quotient cut score and balance, as
discussed in the paper "Fixing two weaknesses of the spectral method",
Kevin Lang, Neural Information Processing Systems, 2005.
